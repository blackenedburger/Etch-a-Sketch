# Etch-a-Sketch
A grid of divs that change colors depending on if the mouse hovers over it.  This project brought me to become more comfortable using javascript and applying it in a more creative way.  Some difficulties that I had were understanding the mouse event listener differences.  I got better practice at creating divs thru javascript and deleting elements by removing child nodes.
